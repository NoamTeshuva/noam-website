## Analytics

The website uses Google Analytics to track visitor metrics and improve user experience. This provides valuable insights into visitor behavior and helps optimize site performance.

## Accessibility

The website follows accessibility best practices to ensure it's usable by everyone:

- Alternative text for all images
- Proper color contrast between background and text
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Semantic HTML structure

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for the website:

- Add more projects to showcase additional work
- Implement a contact form using a service like Formspree
- Continue improving SEO to increase visibility
- Further optimize image sizes and loading times for better performance

## Image Optimization

The profile photo is optimized using the AVIF format for faster loading and better performance, with a PNG fallback for older browsers. The `<picture>` element serves the most efficient image format supported by the visitor's browser.

## 404 Error Handling

A custom 404 page handles non-existing URLs. The page is styled with Tailwind CSS and provides navigation back to the homepage when users encounter broken links.

The 404.html file is located in the public/ folder, and GitHub Pages automatically serves it for invalid routes.

Example: [https://noamteshuva.com/non-existing-page](https://noamteshuva.com/non-existing-page)
