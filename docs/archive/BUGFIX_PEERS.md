# Peers Service Bug Fix

## Issue

When the peers service was first deployed, it caused two critical errors:

### 1. TypeError: symbol.toUpperCase is not a function
**Root Cause**: Changed `getPeersWithInfo()` signature from accepting an array of peer symbols to expecting a single parent symbol, but the store was still calling it with an array.

**Error Location**:
- `peers.js:27` and `peers.js:78`
- Called from `useWatchlistStore.js:146`

**Fix**: Reverted `getPeersWithInfo()` to accept an array of peer symbols (original signature).

### 2. Twelve Data Rate Limit Exceeded
**Error Message**:
```
You have run out of API credits for the current minute.
13 API credits were used, with the current limit being 8.
```

**Root Cause**: The app was already making TD API calls for watchlist symbols, and then attempting to hydrate ALL peers with live quotes, causing excessive API usage.

**Fix**: Removed automatic quote fetching for peers. Peers now show only ticker symbols and company names from static mappings (no live quotes).

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `getPeersWithInfo()` Signature

**Before**:
```javascript
export const getPeersWithInfo = async (parentSymbol) => {
  const hydrated = await getNewPeersHydrated(parentSymbol);
  // ...
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
export const getPeersWithInfo = async (peerSymbols) => {
  if (!peerSymbols || peerSymbols.length === 0) return [];

  const peersWithInfo = peerSymbols.map(symbol => ({
    symbol: symbol,
    name: getCompanyName(symbol),
    sector: getSector(symbol),
    isLoading: false
  }));

  return peersWithInfo;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Company Name Mapping

Added 40+ company names to static mappings, including:
- Hardware: DELL, HPE, HPQ, SMCI, WDC, PSTG, NTAP
- Cruise/Travel: RCL, CCL, NCLH, CUK, BKNG, ABNB, MAR, HLT, EXPE
- Finance: WFC, C, GS, MS
- Healthcare: UNH, ABBV, MRK
- Retail: TGT, HD, LOW, COST

### 3. Enhanced Sector Mapping

Updated sector classifications for all new tickers to show correct industry groupings.

## Impact

### ‚úÖ Fixes
- ‚úÖ No more `toUpperCase` errors
- ‚úÖ No more TD rate limit errors
- ‚úÖ Peers display correctly in watchlist
- ‚úÖ Finnhub integration still works (fetches peer tickers)
- ‚úÖ 24h caching still active

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Peers no longer show live quotes/prices
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Company names come from static mapping (may be incomplete for obscure tickers)

### üí° Benefits
- üí° Significantly reduced API usage
- üí° Faster peer display (no API calls needed)
- üí° No rate limit concerns
- üí° Still shows relevant peer information (ticker + name + sector)

## Future Enhancements

To add live quotes back without hitting rate limits:

1. **On-Demand Hydration**: Only fetch quotes when user clicks/hovers on a peer
2. **Smart Batching**: Group multiple peer quote requests into batched API calls
3. **Longer Delays**: Increase delay to 10-15 seconds between peer hydration calls
4. **Separate Queue**: Use a dedicated rate-limited queue for peer quote requests
5. **Upgrade TD Plan**: Move to higher tier with more requests/minute

## Testing

### Build Status
‚úÖ Compiles successfully
- Bundle size: 77.69 KB (+318 B from previous)

### Manual Testing Needed
1. Add symbol to watchlist (e.g., AAPL)
2. Verify peers appear (should show: DELL, WDC, PSTG, HPE, SMCI)
3. Verify peer names display correctly (e.g., "Dell Technologies Inc.")
4. Verify no console errors
5. Verify no TD rate limit errors

## API Usage After Fix

### Before Fix (Broken)
- 1 symbol in watchlist = 1 TD call for symbol + 5 TD calls for peers = 6 calls
- 3 symbols in watchlist = 18 TD calls ‚Üí **Exceeds 8/min limit** ‚ùå

### After Fix (Working)
- 1 symbol in watchlist = 1 TD call for symbol only = 1 call
- 3 symbols in watchlist = 3 TD calls ‚Üí **Within 8/min limit** ‚úÖ

## Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/peerFetcher.js`**
   - Fixed `getPeersWithInfo()` signature
   - Removed TD API calls from peer hydration
   - Added 40+ company names
   - Enhanced sector mappings

## Deployment

No worker changes needed. Just redeploy the frontend:
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
